								<br><h1>About Me</h1><br>
								<p>My name is Megan McCreight. I am in the ninth grade, and attend Pasadena High School.  I love to read, and spend my weekends building and programming robots with my robotics team.  I like to swim, play tennis, paint, and play piano. I’m also in the Pasadena Youth Symphony Orchestra.  </p> 
								<p>I have a younger brother and sister, two cats and one dog.   My hobbies are reading, listening to music, and swimming.</p>

								<br><h1>My Family</h1><br>
								<p>I am the eldest of my family, the “responsible one”. My siblings are quite strange, but I love them.  My cats, Zia and Zeus, are adventurous and my dog Coco is hilarious. She runs like the dog from ‘Drabble’.</p>
								 <p>  Coco is six years old and the cats are about a year old.  We found them in my Grandpa’s wheel shop, inside a stack of tires. They look completely different, except for their white markings, which are exactly the same.</p>

								<br><h1>The App <br><br> Academy</h1>
								<p>The App Academy is a Computer Science academy to teach kids about programming and problem solving.  This academy is the first of its kind in the United States.  I enjoy being in the academy because it’s an amazing opportunity to learn computer skills. </p> 
								<p> The app academy is a ‘family’ that will be together for all four years of high school.  We are being given opportunities to make something of our futures. The App Academy is the first academy in the U.S. to focus solely on web design and gaming applications.  </p>

								<br><h1>My Hobbies</h1>
								<p>I love to read.  My favorite books are The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern and Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austin.</p> 
								<p>  I also like listening to music. Some of my favorite artists/bands are Adele, Beyoncé, and Paramore.  I don’t have a favorite genre, but I listen to pop and rock more often, and classical music puts me to sleep, even though I am a classical violinist and pianist.</p>

								<br><h1>My Future</h1>
								<p>In the future, I want to be a biotechnologist.  Ever since I was little, I have always wanted to be a doctor because I wanted to do something that would help people.  Since I also like technology, this seems like a career path that I would enjoy following. </p>
								 <p> When I am sixteen, I hope to be accepted into the internship program at City of Hope.</p>
